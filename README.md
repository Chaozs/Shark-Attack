## Reflection:

The mThe main challenge I faced was the time limitation - which meant I could not afford to overscope. It also meant I had to pick performance and functionality over aesthetics, along with doing the minimal to make something work and moving onto new features - something I struggle slightly as a perfectionist. I started the design by splitting into 3 sections - the menu/UI, the actual player, and the map. The problem was I did it in that order, which left a very unpolished map which was done last. I was not able to implement smooth movements, nor animation, nor sound effects for any of the feature as I had spent far too much time on the UI/ instructions which I believed was paramount to being ABLE to play the game, even if not the best game. I chose a low poly/cartoony style that would be appealing to younger kids.
