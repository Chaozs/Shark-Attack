## Final Build

- Final Build can be found under release, with tag 1.0
- Instructions were added here due to lack of time to add to game:
- To play the game - select start game on the main menu
- To move when the game has started - press "W" to move left, or "D" to move right
- To get points, move the shark onto the round fishes
- Make sure you avoid the long thin fishes - you'll lose points instead!


## Reflection:

The main challenge I faced was the time limitation - which meant I could not afford to overscope. It also meant I had to pick performance and functionality over aesthetics, along with doing the minimal to make something work and moving onto new features - something I struggle slightly as a perfectionist. I started the design by splitting into 3 sections - the menu/UI, the actual player, and the map. The problem was I did it in that order, which left a very unpolished map which was done last. I was not able to implement smooth movements, nor animation, nor sound effects for any of the feature as I had spent far too much time on the UI/ instructions which I believed was paramount to being ABLE to play the game, even if not the best game. I chose a low poly/cartoony style that would be appealing to younger kids.

I started the design by splitting into 3 sections - the menu/UI, the actual player, and the map. The problem was I did it in that order, which left a very unpolished map which was done last. I believe this issue can be addressed by creating a proper priority list for features to implement. I was not able to implement smooth movements, nor animation, nor sound effects for any of the feature as I had spent far too much time on the UI/ instructions which I believed was paramount to being ABLE to play the game, even if the end result was not the greatest. 

For Design choices:
- I chose a low poly/cartoony style that would be appealing, and approaching, and not-scary to younger kids
- Control scheme is simple - 2 buttons to move Right and left as to not overwhelm the player 
- The fishes that spawn in are randomized - allowing for repeated playthroughs that are not exactly the same
